"""Shared fixtures for tests that run against a real TimescaleDB.

These tests drive the real ScribeWriter against a real database and a real
Home Assistant registry, then assert on what actually landed in the tables —
as opposed to the mocked suites, which assert on the SQL that was issued.

Start the database they expect with:

    docker run -d --name scribe-test-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=scribe \
        -e POSTGRES_DB=scribe -p 55432:5432 timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg17 \
        -c timescaledb.max_background_workers=0

Background jobs are off so the scheduler cannot run a policy on a table a test
is dropping: cancelling one has crashed the whole server (see
docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, section 6.2). Tests that need a job run it themselves.

Every test here skips itself when no database answers, so the suite still runs
anywhere. CI provides a service container and fails if they skip.
