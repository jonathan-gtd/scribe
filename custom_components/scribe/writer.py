"""Database writer for Scribe.

This module handles the asynchronous writing of data to the TimescaleDB database.
It implements an asyncio-based writer that buffers events and writes them in batches
to minimize database connection overhead and blocking.

NOTE: This version uses asyncpg directly (no SQLAlchemy) to avoid the greenlet
dependency which is not available on Python 3.14 / Alpine Linux (Home Assistant OS).

        (a foreign key to ``entities.id``), so a rename is a single cheap UPDATE on
        the small ``entities`` table — no history rows are moved or rewritten, and we
        never touch the compressed ``states_raw`` hypertable.

        Collision handling: the target ``new_entity_id`` may already exist in
        ``entities``. That row is **not** automatically assumed to be dead — with
        entity_id "musical chairs" (A → clim while B leaves clim) or a Scribe event
        backlog, it can still belong to a *live* entity, and clobbering it would
        corrupt/misroute that entity's data. So we only take the name over when the
        occupant is a *provably dead orphan*: its registry coordinates
        (``unique_id``, ``domain``, ``platform``) are all known and resolve to
        nothing in Home Assistant's live entity registry. In that case the orphan is
        *reused*: its ``states_raw`` rows are folded into the renamed entity's
        ``metadata_id`` and its ``entities`` row is deleted, so the renamed entity
        carries one continuous history under the new name (typical case: the same
        physical device re-added with a new ``unique_id``). This is the one path
        that rewrites ``states_raw`` rows — proportional to the orphan's history
        size, inside the rename transaction.
        If the occupant is still live — or we cannot prove it is dead (missing
        ``unique_id``/``domain``/``platform``) — we refuse and leave everything
